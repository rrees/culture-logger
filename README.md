# Heroku Culture Logger

A simple logging application designed to record events. Initially built to simply remember the name of films and plays I'd seen but then also in time to start answering what were my personal best films or books of the year.

This is a simple Python/Flask application that is meant to be deployed on Heroku so with a bit of environment setting (requires a default Postgres database) you should be able to copy or fork the code and customise to your own needs.
